   <h2>About this demo</h2>
   <p>
      The <a class="highlighted" href="http://www.digitalmishnah.org/">Digital Mishnah Project</a> will provide users with a database of digitized manuscripts of the Mishnah from around the world, along with tools for collation, comparison, and analysis. This demo provides fully marked up transcriptions of twenty-two witnesses to a sample chapter, <cite>Bava Metsia</cite> ch 2, and illustrates basic functionalities. In a number of cases, the witnesses available for browse expand beyond the sample chapter to include all of Bava Qamma, Bava Metsi'a, and Bava Batra.

         </form></td> <td>The <a class="highlighted" href="collate-hl">collate</a> function allows for the detailed comparison of witnesses. At its core it runs a set of texts through <a href="http://collatex.sourceforge.net/">CollateX</a>, which aligns matching words ("tokens"). The Digital Mishnah site remerges this output with the original textual data and represents the results both as an alignment table, and as a text with critical apparatus. The user can determine the passage, the witnesses, and the order. Because we anticipate that a number of users will prefer a parallel-column ("synoptic") presentation, the collate page shows an arrangement of the selected passage arranged in parallel columns by witness in the user-specified order.</td>
